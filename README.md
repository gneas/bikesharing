## Project Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to examine an existing bike sharing business in New York City in order to determine if a similar business would be viable in Des Moines, IA. This analysis would be used as a starting point for investors to examine the proposed venture.
## Results

Below are descriptions of the visualizations you will find at the link above.
- A map detailing the concentrations of the starting locations within the city.
- A map detailing the concentrations of the ending locations within the city.
- The trip durations for the users based in hours. Most trips were under an hour.
- The trip durations for the users based in hours but also further examined by gender. Males were the highest users.
- Trips by weekday and hour. Most trips occurred during work commuting times.
- Trips by weekday and hour by gender. These were consistent with eachother, but as mentioned earlier, males were the highest users.
- From a usertype perspective, males seem to be more likely to be subscribers.
## Summary
From the analysis it is evident that the most active use occurs by males in the summer, particularly during August. Two additional visualizations which may be useful in further examining this business proposal would be to look at the times in the year when ridership is at its lowest. Having a complete picture of the seasonality would aid investors in determining if their investment would be worthwhile. Additionally, incorporating a view around user age ranges would be helpful in determining a target demographic that could be useful toward marketing the business.
